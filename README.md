## **Content**

1. **The MacroecologyEID_df.RData in the [Data](./Data) folder provides the complete dataset.**

2. **The R scripts in the [Code](./Code) folder can be used to reproduce the case study:**
   - `MacroecologyEID_macrovars.R` calculates host richness and functional richness at the municipality level.
   - `MacroecologyEID_models.R` runs the Random Forest models using `MacroecologyEID_df.RData` as input.

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Load the dataset from the [Data](./Data) folder.
3. Run the [scripts](./Code) to reproduce the analysis and figure (expected run time ~30 min).
