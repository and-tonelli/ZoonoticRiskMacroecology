2. **The R scripts in the [Code](./Code) folder can be used to reproduce the case study:**
   - `MacroecologyEID_macrovars.R` calculates host richness and functional richness at the municipality level.
   - `MacroecologyEID_models.R` runs the Random Forest models using `MacroecologyEID_df.RData` as input.
